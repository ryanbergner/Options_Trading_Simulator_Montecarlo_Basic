# Options_Trading_Simulator_Montecarlo_Basic

Welcome. I made this program so my roomates and I could better predict the future value of option contracts. The program uses aspects of the Black-Scholes differential equation to model the path of the option's predicted value:

 Information regarding the model and how it works can be found here:

The program runs the path in a Montecarlo simulation over multiple iterations to determine an accurate future value. The distribution of predicted values approaches normal as more iterations are used.

Currently making a more user friendly version of this program... stay tuned.
